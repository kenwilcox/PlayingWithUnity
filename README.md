# PlayingWithUnity
Playing with Unity (the IoC not the game engine)

This sample code doesn't do anything special. It does however show how to use [Unity](http://unity.codeplex.com/) to set up [Dependancy Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).

It also shows how you can use [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4) to run the tests.

~~One day I'll get resharper to play nice with Moq. It seems to dislike all the classes.~~ Just restarted Visual Studio and it's working now (weird).
